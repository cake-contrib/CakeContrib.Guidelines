Thanks for installing CakeContrib.Guidelines.

Currently your Visual Studio might show the icon.png as missing (with a red "x"). 
This is due to the fact, that is not actually there. It will, however be copied upon build.

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO:

Once you have built the project the "icon.png" will exist. After that open
project-properties -> Package -> IconFile and input "icon.png"

Is there more?
Yes. Read the docs at https://github.com/cake-contrib/CakeContrib.Guidelines/
