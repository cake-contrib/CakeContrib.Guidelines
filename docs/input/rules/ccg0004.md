 > Cake-reference has not set `PrivateAssets="all"`

## Cause

This error is raised, when either `Cake.Core` or `Cake.Common` are referenced without having `PrivateAssets="all"` set.

## Description

References to `Cake.Core` or `Cake.Common` are usually only used for local compilation and should not
be exposed to consuming packages.

## How to fix violations

Add the attribute `PrivateAssets="all"` to all required references.
(Or opt-out of this rule, by setting `CakeContribGuidelinesCakeReferenceOmitPrivateCheck`)
