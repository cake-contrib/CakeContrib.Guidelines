## Cause

This warning is raised, when the addin/module is packaged for NuGet but does not include a recommended tag.

Also, this warning is raised when a comma (`,`) is found in the list of tags,
as comma is not a supported delimiter for tags in NuGet.

## Description

NuGet packages should be correctly tagged have good discoverability and installation instructions in the NuGet gallery.

## How to fix violations

Add the recommended tag(s) to the project (example for an addin) and
separate them either by space (` `) or by semicolon (`;`):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PackageTags>cake;build;cake-build;script;addin;cake-addin</PackageTags>
</PropertyGroup>
```
