## Cause

This warning is raised, when the addin is not targeted to a recommended target version.
Also, This could be raised as an error, if a required target version is not set.

## Description

Addins should be multi-targeted to different framework versions to have the maximum compatibility.

## How to fix violations

Add the recommended target(s) to the project (example for an addin referencing Cake.Core 1.0.0):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net461;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>
```

(Or opt-out of this rule, by setting `CakeContribGuidelinesOmitTargetFramework`)
