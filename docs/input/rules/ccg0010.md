## Cause

This warning is raised, when the addin/module references a package that is provided by Cake
and either does not have `PrivateAssets="all"` set, or is referenced in the wrong version.

## Description

If Addins/modules reference packages that are provided by Cake,
the version should match and the reference should have `PrivateAssets="all"` set.

## How to fix violations

Reference packages that are already provided by Cake in the correct version
and set `PrivateAssets="all"` on the `PackageReference`.
