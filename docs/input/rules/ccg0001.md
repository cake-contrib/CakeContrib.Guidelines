## Cause

This error is raised, when `PackageIcon` is not set in project.

## Description

The guideline [CakeContrib-Icon](../guidelines/CakeContribIcon) states, that the icon should be embedded.
To that end, setting `PackageIcon` is required.

## How to fix violations

This error will only show, if `CakeContribGuidelinesIconOmitImport` is `True` and no manual include of the icon was done.

To fix this error, you need to remove the definition of `CakeContribGuidelinesIconOmitImport` or define a `PackageIcon` manually.
