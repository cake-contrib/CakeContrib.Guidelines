 > PackageIcon points to wrong place

## Cause

This warning is raised, when `PackageIcon` does not point to the copied icon. 
(I.e. `PackageIcon` is not equal to `$(CakeContribGuidelinesIconDestinationLocation)`)

## Description

Since the correct icon is copied to `$(CakeContribGuidelinesIconDestinationLocation)` it is expected, that this icon is packaged into the nupkg.

## How to fix violations

Modify `PackageIcon` to point to the same place as `$(CakeContribGuidelinesIconDestinationLocation)`.
