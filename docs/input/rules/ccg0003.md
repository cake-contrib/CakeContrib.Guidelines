## Cause

This warning/error is raised, when the source of `PackageIcon` was outdated 
but could not be updated. 

## Description

The default package icon is a `png` and will be used to update outdated icons.
If a different icon format than `png` is used, simply updating that icon with a
`png` content will break the icon.

If a `PackageIcon` is set, but no corresponding icon reference could be
found, a reference should be added automatically. However, if `PackageIcon`
is not set to a `png` file, such reference would not be possible.
In this case `CCG0003` is an error and will break the build.

If a `PackageIcon` is set with a corresponding icon reference but not to
a `png` file, a test whether the icon is up-to-date is not possible.
In this case `CCG0003` is a warning .

## How to fix violations

Modify `PackageIcon` to point to a `png` file or remove the custom file entirely.
